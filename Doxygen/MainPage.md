Funky Engine is a little game engine made for learning purposes.  
  
The main idea for the project was to at last learn any rendering API at a sufficient level.  
Currently, I'm focusing on creating DirectX11 backend, followed with all features needed by a game engine such as:
    - assets management
    - memory management
    - multithreading
    - forward rendering
    - flexible config files
    - scripting (lua)

Aaaand so on, the project is made in my spare time so it may progress in a snaily manner.
